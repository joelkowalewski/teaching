# Instructional Colab Notebooks on NLP and GenAI
This repository is a collection of Colab notebooks authored by myself or others. The collection is curated to empahsize simplicity, to be more instructive, and may not cover all use cases. They are therefore great tutorials and are used as resources for my courses. Additional details can be found in the notebook files. There are also subdirectories in this repository to organize the conent by topic. In some cases, the subdirectory is for a specific class that I am teaching.
