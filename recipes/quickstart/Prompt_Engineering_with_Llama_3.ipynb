            "1. **Chain of Thought**: Break down complex tasks into a series of simpler, connected prompts. This helps the model understand the context and relationships between ideas.\n",

            "Example:\n",
            "```\n",

            "The model will understand that the answers are related and provide more accurate responses.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Self-Referential Prompts**: Use the model's own responses as input for subsequent prompts. This creates a feedback loop that can refine the output.\n",

            "Example:\n",
            "```\n",
            "Q1: Write a short story about a character who discovers a hidden world.\n",
            "Q2: Take the last sentence of the previous response and use it as the first sentence of a new story.\n",
            "```\n",
            "This pattern can lead to interesting, iterative storytelling.\n",
            "\n",
